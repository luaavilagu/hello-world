# hello-world
First repository in GitHub 

Something new needed to be written, so today I created an account in GitHub, created a workspace at IBM where  the idea is to practice and play with 12 free months (watson)

Juan send my an article about IoT in IBM, and told me I could create my own application for WindowsPhone
